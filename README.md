# Qotom Q1900G4-M

This repo contains some system information for the Qotom Q1900G4-M.

tl;dr:

- Intel Celeron J1900 (Quad @ 1.99GHz)
- 4x Intel I211-AT Gigabit Controller (each connected via a internal PCIe x1 link)
- Full height Mini PCIe slot (mSATA only)
- Half* height Mini PCIe slot (USB 2.0 only)
- 2.5" SATA Connector (including power)
- Ralink RT3070 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g/n (connected via USB 2.0 the half height Mini PCIe slot)
- SIM card slot (serial 16550A)

_* If you add a screw, it could probably hold a full height card._

Hardware Notes: 

- The Q190G4N-S07 does not come with any cables or room in the case to add an SSD/HDD
- The Q190G4N-S08 has a SATA cable and a _small_ amount of room to fit a 2.5" SSD (the mounting screws do not fit, I used velcro)
- The DDR3 and SSD in my system are _not_ from Qotom
